### Key Concepts Used

This project utilizes essential React concepts, such as:

1. Components: Modular, reusable UI elements for a clean, organized structure.
2. JSX: React's syntax extension to write HTML within JavaScript.
3. Props and PropTypes: For passing and validating data between components.
4. State Management with useState: For managing component-specific data.
5. React Hooks: useEffect for lifecycle management and data fetching.
6. React Router: Used for defining and managing different routes in a single-page application (SPA), allowing users to navigate between pages like Home, Products, and Contact without reloading the page.
7. Navigation and Links: Implements navigation components, like a navigation bar with links, to allow users to move smoothly between pages. <Link> components replace traditional anchor tags for optimized routing in React.

### Data Handling and Management

To handle and manage data efficiently in this project, I have used:

- Context API: For global state management, providing data across multiple components without prop drilling.
- Local Storage: To persist user preferences, such as favorite gadgets, across sessions.
